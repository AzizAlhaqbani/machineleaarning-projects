### Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project our objective is to build an optimal machine learning model to estimate the best selling price for a client’s home in the Boston metropolitan area based on a statistical analysis of the historical data.

### Find Donors for CharityML

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. Our objective will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent to ask for donations.

### Creating Customer Segments

In this project, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers of a fictitious wholesale retailer, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques in order to help the retailer make more informed business decisions.

### Train a Smartcab How to Drive

In this project, we apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time by implementing an optimized Q-Learning algorithm.

### Dog Breed Classifier
In this project, we will build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.
